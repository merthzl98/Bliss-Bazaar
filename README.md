<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>Bliss Bazar is an e-commerce platform where users can browse products across multiple categories and utilize advanced filtering options.

<h3>User Role</h3>
<p>In addition to the features available to guest users, regular users <b>can add products to their favorites list</b>. They can access this list through the avatar icon in the navbar and remove items from the list if desired. Users <b>can also purchase products</b> added to the cart.</p>

<h4>User Credentials for Login:</h4>
Â» Email: <b>user@user.com</b> <br>

<h3>Admin Role</h3>
<p>Admin users have all the features available to regular users. Additionally, they <b>can delete listed products</b> and access the list of deleted items through the avatar icon in the navbar. Admins also have the ability to <b>relist deleted products</b> if necessary.</p>

<h4>Admin Credentials for Login:</h4>
